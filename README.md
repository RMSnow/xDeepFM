# xDeepFM

A preview version of our submitted paper : eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM).

As stated in the paper, we are developing an opensource deep learning based factorization toolkit and all mentioned models will be released upon the acceptance of the paper. Currently we only release the source code of xDeepFM model for reference. Some early works can be found here: https://github.com/Leavingseason/OpenLearning4DeepRecsys.
